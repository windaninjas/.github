The app works well. Currently have 3 window cleaners using it paying Â£6.99 a month (this currently covers server/equipment costs) and i am starting my own round on it aswell.

I cover all server costs so there are no costs to you other than any free time you might have. After all winter is coming.

<b>TODO</b>

PRIORITY: need a website being properly made to advertise it again i will host it on my AWS account at my own expense 


OTHERS: Small bugs in app that dont make it unusable just can be annoying. Also would like advice on layout etc.

Cheers
